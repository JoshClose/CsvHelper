When writing, the fields will be written in the order of the field indexes.\r\nName(String[]) | When reading, is used to get the field at the index of the name if there was a header specified. It will look for the first name match in the order listed. When writing, sets the name of the field in the header record. The first name will be used.\r\nNameIndex(Int32) | When reading, is used to get the index of the name used when there are multiple names that are the same.\r\nOptional() | Ignore the member when reading if no matching field name can be found.\r\nTypeConverter(ITypeConverter) | Specifies the ``CsvHelper.Configuration.MemberMap`2.TypeConverter(CsvHelper.TypeConversion.ITypeConverter)`` to use when converting the member to and from a CSV field.\r\nTypeConverter&lt;TConverter&gt;() | Specifies the ``CsvHelper.Configuration.MemberMap`2.TypeConverter(CsvHelper.TypeConversion.ITypeConverter)`` to use when converting the member to and from a CSV field.\r\nValidate(Func&lt;String, Boolean&gt;) | Specifies an expression to be used to validate a field when reading.\r\n"}}
