- Massive speed improvements to the `CsvParser`.
- Speed improvements to `CsvSerializer`.
- Map child properties so multiple mapping classes aren't needed.
- `ConvertUsing` implementation for writing.
- Read/write `IEnumerable` properties.
- Field mapping.
- Async reading/writing.
- Added `ClassMapBuilder` to build maps on the fly without a mapping class.

- `IDictionary` type converters.
- Added trim options to trim in parser and removed trim from reader.
- Header validation.
- Field validation.
- Added `leaveOpen` flag to constructors to not dispose of underlying `TextReader` and `TextWriter`.

Both the header field name and the property name are ran through this method before matching against each other.
- Added interfaces for configuration so you can tell what options are available in your current context.
- Moved detection of column count changes into the reader. The parser shouldn't care and should just return whatever data it finds.
- `ConstructUsing` works with reference maps.
- `ConstructUsing` can use initializers.

- Auto mapping with user defined `struct`.

- Added a `Flush` method to the writer so `NextRecord` just writes a line ending. This will allow users to not write a line ending if they want.
- Removed statics to eliminate possible threading issues.
- Added `SerializableAttribute` to exception classes. It was removed previously because of netstandard1.x not having it available.
- Added `ByteArrayConverter`.
- Reading anonymous types.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with `CsvClassMapCollection[type]` choosing the wrong type when multiple types on the inheritance tree are mapped.
- Fixed issue where setting `Configuration.ShouldSkipRecord` method always overrides the `Configuration.SkipEmptyRecords` setting.
- Fixed issue where ignoring header whitespace wouldn't work if a named property had the same whitespace in it.
- When comments are on and a field is being written that is the first field in the record and the first char is a comment char, quote the field because it's not a comment.
- Fixed issue with type converter options set in factory not working with auto mapping or explicit map.
- Fixed line ending spanning buffer issue.
- Fixed issue of skipping a character if a line ending was within a quoted field.
- Added locking to factory to make it thread safe.
- Fixed bug when mapping a constant then mapping another property after will throw an exception.
- Changed reflection calls to `ConvertToString` to get the method for `ITypeConverter` instead of the actual converter. This is so the overridden implementation will be used instead of a random method with the same name.
- Adding locking in `ReflectionHelper.CreateInstance` for the static delegate cache.
- Fixed quote handling issue of `IsFieldBad` by marking unquoted fields with quote chars as bad only when `Configuration.IgnoreQuotes` is `false`.

- Fixed issue with private properties not being able to be set.
- Fixed issue with getting the class map from the collection. It was only getting the current and not looking up the tree.
- Fixed issue with `Constant` not working with `null`.

#### Breaking Changes

- Removed all .NET builds except for net45 and netstandard2.0.
- Removed obsolete code.
 - `object ICsvReader.GetField( int index, ITypeConverter converter )`
 - `object ICsvReader.GetField( string name, ITypeConverter converter )`
 - `object ICsvReader.GetField( string name, int index, ITypeConverter converter )`
 - `void ICsvWriter.WriteField( Type type, object field )`
 - `void ICsvWriter.WriteField( Type type, object field, ITypeConverter converter )`
 - `void ICsvWriter.WriteRecord( Type type, object record )`
- Moved methods that aren't row level out of `ICsvReaderRow` and into `ICsvReader`.
 - `IEnumerable<T> GetRecords<T>()`
 - `IEnumerable<object> GetRecords( Type type )`

 - `void ClearRecordCache( Type type )`
 - `void ClearRecordCache()`

- Removed configuration `IsHeaderCaseSensitive`, `IgnoreHeaderWhiteSpace`, and `TrimHeaders` and added `PrepareHeaderForMatch`.
- Changed `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` converters to not work when the `string` is spaces to match what all the other converters do. The .NET Framework `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` converters will convert a `string` of all spaces into `MinValue`, so we are diverging from that a little.
- Changed `ReadHeader` to not set `CurrentRecord` to `null`.
- Removed Excel specific code. This will go into a separate library. The malformed fallback behavior that mimics Excel still exists.
- Moved reading/writing state data into a common context object that is shared.

- Removed `Csv` prefix from all classes except `CsvReader`, `CsvParser`, `CsvWriter`, and `CsvSerializer`.
- Removed default `null` values since there is no common standard that could be found.
- Removed default `boolean` values of `yes`, `y`, `no`, `n` since it's not a standard boolean. `true`, `false`, `1`, `0` still work.
- Changed default delimiter to `,` instead of ListSeparator.
- Added a `Flush` method to the writer.
- Changed `Property` naming to `Member`.
- Removed `Configuration`s `ThrowOnBadData`, `IgnoreReadingExceptions`, `SkipEmptyRecords`, and `WillThrowOnMissingField` in favor of function callbacks.

  - `TypeConverterFactory` to `TypeConverterCache`
  - `TypeConverterOptionsFactory` to `TypeConverterOptionsCache`
  - `Configuration.HeaderValidatedCallback` to `Configuration.HeaderValidated`
  - `Configuration.MissingFieldFoundCallback` to `Configuration.MissingFieldFound`

  - `FieldReader` to `CsvFieldReader`
  - `ICsvReader` to `IReader`
  - `ICsvReaderRow` to `IReaderRow`
  - `ICsvSerializer` to `ISerializer`
  - `ICsvWriter` to `IWriter`
  - `ICsvWriterRow` to `IWriterRow`

- Added `DateTimeOffset` converter.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed exception that was occurring when fields were empty and `UseExcelLeadingZerosFormatForNumerics = true`.
- Excel compatibility fix. If a field starts with a quote but never ends and the end of the file is reached, the field would be null. The field will now contain everything.
- Don't get static properties when automapping.
- Made all exceptions thrown contain Exception.Data["CsvHelper"].
- Fixed missing support writing the double quotes for inner quotes on a quoted field. This used to be there and was removed at some point. A unit test is now in place so this doesn't happen again.

### 2.7.1

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with mappings overwriting an explicitly set index when re-indexing.
- Auto mapping will ignore Enumerable properties instead of throwing an exception. Exceptions will still be thrown if an Enumerable is used outside of auto mapping.

### 2.4.1

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where parsing would add delimiter chars to the field when the buffer ran out in the middle of the delimiter.

### 2.4

#### Features

- Split writing up into a writer and serializer so the writer can write other things besides CSV files.

### 2.0.0

#### Features

- Added parser configuration to ignoring quotes and treating them like any other character.
